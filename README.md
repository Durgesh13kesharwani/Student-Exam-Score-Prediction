# Student-Exam-Score-Prediction
Project Report
Introduction:
This project aims to predict students' exam scores based on various features. The dataset contains information about students' demographics, academic performance, and other attributes. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate students' final grades (G3).

Data Exploration and Visualization:

Visualized the correlation between features.
Analyzed the distribution of final grades.
Investigated the relationship between study time and final grades.
Modeling and Evaluation:

Built a Random Forest Regressor model.
Evaluated the model using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
Achieved an accuracy of 81.16% and an error percentage of 18.84%.
Future Work:

Implement additional feature engineering techniques.
Experiment with different models and ensemble methods.
Perform extensive hyperparameter tuning to further improve accuracy.
